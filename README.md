# Title of research
The title of the research was the training needs for registered midwives in two Comprehensive Emergency Obstetrics and Neonatal Care Facilities in Eswatini
# Purpose
The purpose was to determine trainings that would inform a training programme for registered midwives
## Data collection tool
A Hennessy-Hicks Questionnaire was used to collect data from N=202 registered midwives. The tool had 37 items measured on a seven point Likert Scale of task importance and task performance. The items are grouped into five categories also called superordinate categories. Part of Section C of the tool required open-ended responses. 
## Data analysis
The tool had three sections. Sections A, B and C. Section A was demographic characteristics. Section B had four sections which were specifically on training needs, sections A,B,C and D. Section A asked on task importance and section B on task perforance. Respondents had to rate their perceptions on task importance and task perfomance  on a 7 point Likert Scale from 1-7. For importance, the respondent has to indicate from "not important" to "extremely important". For task performance, ratings were for "not well" to "extremely well". To analyze the data, if indicator B (perceived task performance) was lower than indicator A (perceived task importance), then there was a training need. Paired t-test was used to determine sgnificance in dfferences between each category pair. Section C of the tool was an open-ended question that required mentioning of training needs by the respondents.
